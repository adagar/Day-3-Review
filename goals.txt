Adalberto "Nick" Garza

Goals:
* Be able to create interesting prototypes that use new tech like AR & VR and/or educational games
* Get developer job that has me working alongside brilliant and passionate people who are excited about what they're making
* Eventually be skilled enough that I can work independently if desired. Move to the woods.
